# Continuous Action Bandits with Data Reuse

In this directory there is:

    > ./outcomes -- a directory that experimental results will be written to
    > ./notebooks/paper.ipynb -- a Jupyter notebook which recreates the plots in the paper
    > ./run_online.py -- This will run the online experiments and generate the data exhaust.
    > ./run_offline.py -- This will run the offline experiments. You must run the online experiments first to generate the data exhaust.

Dependencies
    > Pytorch    (see the pytorch website)

    > Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
